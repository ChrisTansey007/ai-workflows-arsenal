## 🎓 Key Concepts to Understand

### Workflow Types
1. **Sequential** - Steps run in order
2. **Parallel** - Steps run simultaneously
3. **Conditional** - Steps run based on conditions
4. **Event-driven** - Triggered by events
5. **Scheduled** - Run on a schedule

### Workflow Components
1. **Triggers** - What starts the workflow
2. **Steps** - Individual actions
3. **Conditions** - Decision points
4. **Integrations** - External tools
5. **Outputs** - Results produced

### Platform Categories
1. **Code-based** - Written in files (.yml, .py)
2. **Visual** - Drag-and-drop interfaces
3. **Hybrid** - Both code and visual
4. **AI-native** - Built for AI workflows
5. **Traditional** - Pre-AI automation

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Time Savers
```
✅ Use template docs (copy-paste-edit)
✅ Set timers for each task
✅ Batch similar activities
✅ Take breaks every 90 minutes
✅ Review daily to avoid rework
```

### Quality Boosters
```
✅ Verify examples actually work
✅ Cross-reference multiple sources
✅ Ask "why" not just "how"
✅ Document your reasoning
✅ Get second opinions
```

### Common Mistakes
```
❌ Researching forever (set deadlines!)
❌ Poor organization (use templates!)
❌ Ignoring community (join forums!)
❌ Not testing examples (verify!)
❌ Inconsistent documentation (use standards!)
```
